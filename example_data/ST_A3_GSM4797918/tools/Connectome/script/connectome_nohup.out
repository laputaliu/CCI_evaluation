Calculating p-values using Wilcoxon Rank
Calculating cluster Pericytes
For a more efficient implementation of the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test,
(default method for FindMarkers) please install the limma package
--------------------------------------------
install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install('limma')
--------------------------------------------
After installation of limma, Seurat will automatically use the more 
efficient implementation (no further action necessary).
